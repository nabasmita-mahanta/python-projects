# Factorial of a Number - Using Iterative approach
"""
Factorial of a non-negative integer,
is multiplication of all integers smaller than or equal to n.

For example factorial of 6 is 6*5*4*3*2*1 which is 720.

Write a python program to Find the Factorial of a Number Using Iterative approach

Examples:

Input : 6
Output : 750

Input : 5
Output : 120
"""

number = input('Enter any number: ')


def factorial(num):
    # Complete this function
    pass


print(f'Factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}')
